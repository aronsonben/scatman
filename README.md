I am making a Google Chrome extension to enhance my SoundCloud experience. SoundCloud hasn't allowed anyone to use their API in years, so we're making a workaround (boo soundcloud).

Here are some thoughts:

# Goals

I want to implement three main things:

- A&R Discocat - When I find a cool artist, add them to a database by marking when I first discovered them and how many followers they had

- SoundCloud Interactor - Keep track of which artists I wrote a message to for promo, which replied, which I should collaborate with, and which I should highlight

- SoundCloud Network Graph - Categorize artists based off interactions, sounds/genre, groups, collectives, etc. Build a Civ IV-type graph of who is connected
